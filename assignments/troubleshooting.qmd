## Missing Git tab in RStudio

If you are missing your Git tab in RStudio, the most likely culprit is that you simply don't have the RStudio project for the repository open in RStudio. In the upper right-hand corner of RStudio, you can see the current project that is open. If you do not have a project open, you might see this:

![](/files/img/no_project.png)

To get to your project, simply click on that Project: (None) button to reveal a list of recent projects, from which you will usually see the one you are working on:

## Errors pushing to GitHub

If you trying to push to GitHub and you get an error saying something like:

> /usr/bin/git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main To https://github.com/gov50-f23/gov-50-hw-2-mattblackwell.git ! [rejected] HEAD -> main (non-fast-forward) error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/gov50-f23/gov-50-hw-2-mattblackwell.git' hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g. hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again. hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

This can happen if you edit the repository manually on the GitHub website rather than in your local version. Sometimes you can fix this problem by simply hitting the "Pull" button in RStudio:

![](/files/img/pull.png)

If this solves your problem, great! If you get an error message when trying to pull, then you'll need to resolve the conflicts manually. First start a new session of RStudio by going to the Session menu and hitting "New Session":

![](/files/img/new_session.png)

This will open a new RStudio window. In this new window, we are going to create a new project from the same repository. When creating this new project, be sure to add `_new` to the end of the project directory name:

![](/files/img/new_clone.png)

Now you should have two RStudio sessions with two different projects: the original local one and a new one directly from GitHub:

![](/files/img/both_projects.png)

Assuming you want to overwrite whatever is on the GitHub website with what is on you local computer, copy the contents of your Rmd file from the old RStudio project to the same Rmd file in the new RStudio project. In the new RStudio project, knit the Rmd file, commit any changes, and then push to GitHub. Thew new RStudio project should be all synced now. 

Once you are confident that the new project has all of the changes that you want, simply delete the old RStudio project from your computer. 


## Final project website is not updating

If you have committed and pushed a change to your final project repository and confirmed that the website has deployed (by looking at the green check), but there are no changes to the actual project website, there could be a couple of problems. First, check to make sure you have knitted the Rmd file to HTML and then committed and pushed any changes to the HTML file to GitHub. 

Second, you might check the website in a second browser or incognito window. Sometimes browsers cache versions of the website and don't update them immediately. Finally, sometimes the deploy process just doesn't work or times out for unknown reasons ("internet weather"). In that case, try to add another change, knit, commit, and push to get the process to restart.
